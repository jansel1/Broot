Broot, the tool to obtain lists of passwords using inputted data. This can generate 100,000 passwords in less than 5 seconds, which is incredibly useful for brute forcing into your lost accounts ;)

## What data do I have to input?
* Online username/alias/nickname
* Real name and last name       (NOT REQUIRED)
* Date of birth                 (NOT REQUIRED)
* Extra misc tags (such as favourite foods, pet names, age, etc.)

# Inside BrootV1
Made using Python, compiled using PyInstaller, this is not the tool for speed. Yes, this can make 100,000 in 5 seconds (or less), but this isn't as fast as it could get. If I decide to port to C, it would take like half a second to make 100 billion.
